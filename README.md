# C_project_test
before everything - open cmd and check if the command "python" works.
if not - tell leah!

after that:
1. clone project (in the next stages the path of the cloned folder will be called "repository path").
2. open spkmeans_compare.py.
3. change FINAL_PROJECT_PATH to be your final project path that includes the spkmeans.py file.
4. change TEST_PROJECT_PATH to be your repository path.
5. make sure that your python module name is "mykmeanssp".
6. run "python setup.py build_ext --inplace" as usual to get the most recent module.
7. copy the module build dir and .pyd file to the repository path.
8. open cmd from the repository path.
9. run "python spkmeans_compare.py"
